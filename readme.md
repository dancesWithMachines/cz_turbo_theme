# Mitsubishi Colt CZ Turbo theme for Torque app
This is a custom theme for the Torque app that's supposed to imitate factory gauge set of Mitsubishi Colt CZ (Z30) models with turbo (CZT, CZC "Turbo" trim level). It is not a direct copy, I do not have skills to create fonts, so I had to use what's available.

## File structure
File structure follows guidelines available in [official Torque wiki](https://wiki.torque-bhp.com/view/Themesfree) with additional `raw` directory which contains all the raw files (scans, photos) I used to create this theme. I left it here in case any improvements are needed in the future.

## Fonts
This theme uses two fonts:
* Komika Axis - for values. When I bought the car I made a joke that the gauges were designed with `Comic Sans`, well... Komika Axis is categorized as `Comic Cartoon`, and looks strangely similar to what's used on the factory gauges. This is a popular font developed in the 90s, I really believe it could have been an inspiration for factory gauges, but it was given that "race'y" spin.
* League Spartan Bold - for text, looks similar enough to `x1000r/min` text on factory gauges. This is free equivalent of `Futura` family font, which I believe original author was inspired by too.

Licenses for the fonts can be found in `COPYING.lib` file.
